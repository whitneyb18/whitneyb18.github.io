            <p class="infoParagraph">My name is Whitney Bowman. I am a Utah native and love all things outdoors. I love to go on hikes, ski, travel, eat tacos,
                        and read sci-fi novels. I graduated from Brigham Young University in May 2018 with a Bachelor of Science in Elementary
                        Education. During my time at BYU I worked as an intern teaching 3rd grade in Heber City, Utah. During my internship I
                        was able to develop many important skills including time management, multi-tasking, organization, planning, and setting
                        goals. As a teacher I enjoyed teaching students basic coding and designing my class webpage. After graduation I decided
                        to pursue a career in web development and enrolled in the University of Utahâ€™s Coding Bootcamp.</p>
